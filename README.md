# Data-Structures-Assignment-1
Assignment 1 in course Data Structures

An array V of size m initially contains n sorted natural numbers, while the rest of the array
There are zeros. Suppose the size n is unknown.

Write a program that receives as input the array V, its size m and an additional natural number x.
The program must return the index of the number x in the array, or alternatively return -1 if the number
Does not exist in the array.

For this, write 3 routines:
1. Search1(V,m,x) in O(n) runtime complexity.
2. Search2(V,m,x) in O(logm) runtime complexity.
3. Search3(V,m,x) in O(logn) runtime complexity.
